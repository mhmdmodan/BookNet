Description: Reads a directory of text files and generates
    an adjacency matrix of characters in those text files, with weights
    equal to the number of times the relationship appeared.
    A connection is made when characters appear within
    window_length tokens of each other, delimited by spaces.
    The directory must contain one "names.txt" file which
    consists of Java regular expressions one each line to search for, for a
    given character, ie "Jaime|Kingslayer" would match for
    Jaime Lannister in ASOIAF.
